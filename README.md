# JAVA-FX CONNECT-4-GAME

![Java FX](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Finished-brightgreen.svg)
### I've created the Connect4Game using Java in IntelliJ IDEA. You can access the .JAR file in the repo!
### To run the APP, you must have Java [JDK v8] installed in your system. For a general overview, you can checkout the output screenshots included in the repo!! Thanks :santa:
```bash
  The Connect 4 Game Rules are easy to understand. In fact, it is in the name.
    To win *Connect Four*, all you have to do is to choose a color and then take turns
      dropping colored discs from the top into a *seven-column, six-row* vertically suspended grid.
        The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column.
          The objective of this game is to *connect four* of your colored checker pieces in a row,
            much the same as tic tac toe. This can be done horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
             Each player will drop in one checker piece at a time. This will give you a chance to either build
               your row, or stop your opponent from getting four in a row.
                 
  The game is over either when you or your friend reaches four in a row,
    or when all forty two slots are filled, ending in a stalemate.
      If you and your friend decide to play again, the first player typically goes first.
        The rules of the game are easy to learn, but difficult to master. That is the beauty of Connect Four.
          Now that you know the *Connect 4* board game rules, now is the time to challenge everyone you know.
            No matter their age or skill level, they can play this game with you.
              Now that you understand the rules, share *Connect Four* with everyone around you.
                You’ll be glad you did.
